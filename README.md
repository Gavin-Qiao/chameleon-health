# Chameleon Health

![CI Status](https://github.com/Gavin-Qiao/chameleon-health/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

> **"Healthcare access shouldn't be a lottery, and language shouldn't be a barrier to care."**

## 🌟 The Mission

Chameleon Health exists to break down the invisible walls that separate patients from the care they need. We are building for the families who face the frustration of endless appointment hunting and the anxiety of walking into a doctor's office unable to describe their pain in the local language.

Our goal is simple: **Empower patients with dignity and access.**

## 💡 Our Philosophy

### 1. Human-Centric Technology
We believe technology should work for people, not the other way around. Our tools are designed to be invisible helpers—removing friction without adding complexity. When a parent is worried about a sick child, they shouldn't have to fight a user interface.

### 2. Privacy as a Right
In an era of data harvesting, we stand apart. **Medical-UI** is designed to be ephemeral. We don't store your symptoms, your history, or your location. You own your data; we just help you translate it.

### 3. Universal Accessibility
Health is a universal human need. Our platform is built from day one to bridge the gap between languages (initially French/English) and to be accessible on any device, anywhere, regardless of connection speed.

## 🚀 The Vision

We are starting with **MVP: Medical-UI**, a tool to give a voice to patients who struggle with the local medical language. But this is just the beginning.

We envision a platform where:
*   Appointments are found automatically, not hunted.
*   Medical history travels safely with the patient.
*   "Lost in translation" never leads to a misdiagnosis.
